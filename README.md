# CHARAGUA 

## Peteĩ

*Charagua* is a Guaraní word that means **“place of waters”** and also refers to a territory in the Bolivian Chaco. The Chilean singer-songwriter **Víctor Jara** composed an instrumental piece in **1966**. The piece not only celebrates the land and its people but also invites the listener to **hear the landscape and the memory of the territory**, transforming sound into a bridge between **culture, history, and emotion**.

For this project, we used **Strudel** to code the song, based on the arrangement provided by the music professor of **San Carlos de Quilicura School** in Santiago de Chile: [Charagua Sheet Music](https://colegiosancarlosquilicura.cl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IoMEDIO_charagua_partitura_IImedio.pdf)
